<h3> Plank</h3>
1. Plant the hands directly under the shoulders (slightly wider than shoulder-width apart) like you’re about to do a push-up.
<br>
2. Ground the toes into the floor and squeeze the glutes to stabilize the body.
 Your legs should be working in the move too; careful not to lock or hyperextend your knees.
<br>
3. Neutralize the neck and spine by looking at a spot on the floor about a foot beyond the hands.
 Your head should be in line with your back.
