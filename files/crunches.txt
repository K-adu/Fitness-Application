<h3>Crunches tutorial</h3>
<h6>Step-by-Step Instructions </h6>
1.Lie down on the floor on your back and bend your knees, placing your hands behind your head or across your chest. Some people find that crossing the arms over the chest helps them avoid pulling on the neck. However, if you find your neck is strained, you can keep one hand cradling the head. If you are putting your hands behind your head, your fingers should gently cradle your head. The idea is to support your neck without taking away from the work of your abs.<br>
2.Pull your belly button towards your spine in preparation for the movement. <br>
3.Slowly contract your abdominals, bringing your shoulder blades about 1 or 2 inches off the floor.<br>
4.Exhale as you come up and keep your neck straight, chin up. Imagine you're holding a tennis ball under your chin. That's about the angle you want to keep the chin the entire time.<br>
5.Hold at the top of the movement for a few seconds, breathing continuously.<br>
6.Slowly lower back down, but don't relax all the way.<br>
7.Repeat for 15 to 20 repetitions with perfect form for each rep.<br>
