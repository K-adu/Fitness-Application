<h3>1. Get an Accurate Reading of Your Personal BMI</h3>
Online BMI calculators abound, but you should get your official BMI reading at your doctor’s office from our application "FITNESS FIRST".
<h3>2. Set a Realistic Goal if You’re Trying to Lower Your BMI</h3>
Losing as little as 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can have substantial health benefits, according to the CDC.<br>
For some people, this means that your BMI still may be in the overweight range, and that may be okay.
<h3>3. Track Your Weight Loss Progress Closely</h3>
Know where you stand today — and where you stood yesterday. Then give yourself a pat on the back. <br>“Self-monitoring is really important when it comes to weight control,” says O’Neil.
He recommends recording your food or calorie intake for a few days to understand what your eating habits are truly like. “Many patients will come back and say, ‘I never knew how much I ate,’” he explains.

It may be the reality check you need to change your habits. Use whatever method you feel most comfortable with, <br>
whether that’s writing it in a journal or using an app on your smartphone.<br>
 A February 2019 study published in Obesity found that the more frequently participants used a web app to track their diet habits over six months, the more weight they lost.

<h3>4. Know How Much You Move </h3>
As with monitoring your food intake, you’ve got to know what your physical activity level is like.<br>
 At the Weight Management Center at MUSC, everyone who joins the program gets a Fitbit Zip, which makes it easy to track and record your exercise and everyday movements. (Walking up the stairs counts!) Even if you're not in a program, there are tons of apps at your disposal, whether you’re on an Android or an iPhone, and fitness trackers you can wear on your wrist.


<h3>5. Weigh Yourself Regularly to Figure Out What’s Working (and What Isn’t)</h3>
Once a week, get on the scale. Then chart your weight (this is easy to do via an app, or you can DIY using a graph, like the one from MUSC).<br> This way, you’ll know whether you need to change up your weight loss approach — or stay the course.
<h3>6. Now Get Moving With a Workout of Your Choice</h3>
If you know you need to start exercising more — and your activity log proves it — you’re going to want to exercise. <br>
That doesn’t necessarily mean jumping into kickboxing or trying out CrossFit.

“I tell patients that you don’t get extra credit for doing the toughest exercise you can find,” says O’Neil. He suggests picking an activity that you find fun or tolerable, such as walking your dog or hiking, and making that your regular workout.

<h3>7. Set Workout Targets So You’re More Likely to Stay on Track</h3>
It’s not enough to say that you’re going to start exercising “more.” Rather, plan it out.

Commit to walking for 20 minutes three times this week, and plan the days you’re going to do it and what time — for instance after work on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.<br>
 And if something comes up, know that you can shorten it to 5 or 10 minutes — everything counts.

<h3>8. Clean Up Your Eats to Make Sure Your Diet Is Working for You</h3>
When you want to lose weight, there’s no shortage of diet advice. What’s more, research shows that focusing on both diet and exercise is the best combination for successfully losing weight. (8)

<h3>9. Stay Consistent, Even if You Aren’t Seeing Results Right Away</h3>
Even if the weight doesn’t seem like it’s coming off fast enough, stay the course. It’s only with consistent efforts to eat well, move more, and maintain other healthy habits that affect weight (like getting enough sleep) that the pounds come off permanently, research suggests. (10) Researchers found that when weight jumped up and down — possibly because of inconsistent efforts — people were more likely to give up on their goals. Remember: You’ve got this.
